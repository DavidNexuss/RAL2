# LAB 2 RA

This is the code to run the experiments of the L2 of RA. The code is written in C++, only thing you need to do compile is:

``` bash
make all
```

This will generate a binary called bin/main.

To execute the code you need to call bin/main. The program expects to read a specific input to set the arguments of the experiment execution you have examples and in inputs directoy as well as the input for every plot and value used in the report. Below this README you have a section explaining which input is used to produce which plot in the final report.

Every result of all the inputs in the input directoy is also provided in the results directoy, to generate them using the program run the bash script run.sh which takes all the input files from directory input used in the report and runs the experiments.

So the full code to run is:

```bash
make all
bash run.sh
```
